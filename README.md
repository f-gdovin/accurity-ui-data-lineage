## Maven Dependencies

The UI Workspace project defines runtime dependencies to ensure compatibility with other pool libraries.

| groupId | artifactId | version | scope | notes |

# Running with Maven

It's a good idea to start with building from Maven. This will trigger builds using NodeJS but before that Maven downloads
`node` and `npm` binaries and then all javascript dependencies will be downloaded.

## Install
```
> mvn clean install
```
The JAR file will be generated in the 'target' folder and also installed in your local .m2 repository.

## Run tests with coverage report
```
> mvn clean install -DwithCoverage
```

This will run test also with code coverage. Generally, this is a bit slower than without report generation.

# Running with NodeJS

If you have not installed `npm` into your operating system, you need to use `node/npm` command instead of `npm`.

## Install dependencies for DaLineGraMa

```
> npm install
```

All dependencies will be installed in `node_modules` directory. Sometimes it's
a good idea to remove this directory and do a fresh install.


## Start

```
> npm start
```

This command executes the webpack-dev-server which enabled hot reload and files are served from the 'src' folder.

The DaLineGraMa will start on port http://localhost:3000 but will detect a development
mode and try to connect to your app - see default ports above.
